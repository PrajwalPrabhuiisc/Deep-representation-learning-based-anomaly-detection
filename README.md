# Deep Representation-Based Anomaly Detection for Sensor Data

This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for unsupervised anomaly detection using deep representation learning. The pipeline uses an autoencoder model to learn latent representations of sensor data and detects anomalies based on reconstruction errors. In addition, the project provides detailed visualizations at every stage of the processâ€”from training history and latent space representation to reconstruction errors and cross-correlation analysis across sensors.

## Overview

In many real-world applications, sensor data can contain subtle or drastic anomalies indicating faults or unusual operating conditions. This project leverages deep representation learning with autoencoders to:
- Learn robust, lower-dimensional representations (latent space) of sensor data.
- Detect anomalies by comparing original signals with their reconstructions.
- Visualize the entire process, including training history, latent space projections (via PCA), reconstruction error trends, and cross-sensor correlation analysis.

The pipeline also integrates hyperparameter tuning (if enabled) and saves all visualization outputs in a designated results folder.

## Features

- **Deep Autoencoder Model:** Learns compact representations of sensor data.
- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:** Uses reconstruction errors to flag anomalies.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optionally tune model parameters using silhouette scores.
- **Detailed Visualizations:**
  - **Training History:** Plots training and validation loss over epochs.
  - **Reconstruction Errors:** Time-series and multi-panel visualizations comparing original vs. reconstructed signals.
  - **Latent Space Visualization:** Projects the learned latent space to 2D using PCA.
  - **Cross-Correlation Analysis:** Visualizes the pairwise correlation of reconstruction errors across sensors.
- **Automated Saving of Results:** All plots are automatically saved into a designated folder (`results` by default).
- **Interpretation Module:** Provides textual feedback on sensor performance (e.g., risk levels, trends, and silhouette scores) to help identify malfunctioning sensors.
